= Motivation and introduction to symmetry in physics

The cornerstone of modern physics is, without a shadow of a doubt, symmetry. This 
is thanks to one of the most beautiful theorems of physics. *The Noether theorem*.

The Noether theorem establishes a one to one connection between symmetries and 
conservation laws, thus explaining the origin of conservation of energy, charge and 
all other conservation laws widely used in physics. 

The first question that might arise is, What constitutes a symmetry? What is it?
A symmetry is a transformation, such as translations, rotations or even of the 
internal degrees of freedom a theory might have, that maintains some aspect of the
theory invariant. 

In the case of classical mechanics the main object that encapsulates the behavior 
of the system allowing for the computation of the equations of motion. Therefore 
a symmetry in classical mechanics is any transformation to the lagrangian that 
doesn't change the equations of motion.

In our case we will find that the corresponding symmetries en general relativity
are those that preserve the geometry of spacetime, meaning, the metric. The so 
called isometries. Killing fields are nothing more than the generators of 
isometries.
